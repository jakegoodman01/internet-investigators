The Game
========
Internet Investigator is a one-player detective game, in which the user attempts to expose internet predators disguised 
as kids on social media by solving a series of logic puzzles. In the game, you play as a young boy that just started 
middle school and got his first social media account. Without knowing anyone, you add many friends on social 
media in an attempt to make friends. However, your older brother warns that you should be careful of who you add on 
social media because there are many predators on social media disguised as kids. And then the game begins.

In each level, you are given a group of people and have reason to believe that someone in that group is not who they
say they are. You must figure out which person is an internet predator, and then report them! There are 6 levels in
total, and two level types: Profile levels and Chatbox levels.
